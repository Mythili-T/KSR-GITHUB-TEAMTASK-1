                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An education loan is a sum of money borrowed to finance
                    post-secondary education or higher
                    education-related expenses. Education loans are intended to cover the cost of tuition, books and
                    supplies, and living expenses while the borrower is in the process of pursuing a degree. Payments
                    are often deferred while students are in college and, depending on the lender, for an additional
                    six-month period after earning a degree. This deferment period is also referred to as a "grace
                    period."

                    How an Education Loan Works
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Education loans are issued for the purpose of attending an accredited college or a university to
                    pursue an academic degree. Education loans can be obtained from the government or through
                    private-sector lending sources. Federal loans often offer lower interest rates, and some also offer
                    subsidized interest (meaning the United States Department of Education pays the interest on the loan
                    while a student is in college at least half-time).
                    Private-sector loans generally follow more of a traditional lending process for applications, with
                    rates that are typically higher than federal government loans.

                    Types of Education Loans
                </h1>
                <br>
                <h3>Federal student loans</h3><br>
                <p>Most borrowers first seek federal government financing if they need to borrow funds for education
                    expenses. The first step in seeking education loans through the federal government is to complete a
                    Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

                    Depending on the applicant's status, particularly in regard to their parental dependency, additional
                    information may be required to complete the application. A credit check is not generally required as
                    part of the application process. The amount of principal on the loan or loans is primarily based on
                    the cost of attendance at the school the student is planning on attending. Once a FAFSA form is
                    completed, the schools listed on the FAFSA application work to identify the financial aid package
                    that the student is eligible for.



                    Various types of federal student loans exist, including direct subsidized, direct unsubsidized, and
                    direct consolidation loans. If offered and accepted, funds will be issued by the federal government
                    to the specified university to cover the student's academic costs. If there are remaining funds
                    available, they will be disbursed to the student. A student may use these funds to cover other
                    expenses that they incur while pursuing a degree. If a student qualifies for subsidized loans, the
                    borrower's interest will be covered while they are in school. If a student qualifies for
                    unsubsidized loans, the interest on their loans will be deferred as long as they are enrolled in
                    classes and remain in good academic standing.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Private student loans</h3><br>
                <p>
                    In some cases, the student loan package that a student is issued through the federal government may
                    suggest that the borrower applies for additional funds through private lenders. Private student
                    loans also include state-affiliated lending nonprofits and institutional loans provided by the
                    schools. These types of loans will generally follow a more standard application process (like what
                    is typical of any private-sector loan). Applications for private student loans typically require a
                    credit check.

                    Borrowers can apply directly to individual private-sector lenders for funds. Similar to federal
                    funds, the approved amount will be influenced by the school a borrower is attending. If approved,
                    funds for educational expenses will first be disbursed to the school to cover any pending bills; the
                    remaining amount is then sent directly to the borrower.

                </p>

                <h1>Special Considerations</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Accumulated debt from college can be an overwhelming burden after graduation.

                    If a student has taken out numerous education loans, consolidating them can be a good option for
                    more easily managing the debt load. Multiple federal education loans can be combined into a single
                    direct consolidation loan.

                    Also, many private lenders now allow borrowers to combine both their federal and private loans into
                    one loan. It's important to note that in this scenario, the new loan will be a private one because
                    it will be issued by a private lender. Because the loan will be considered a private loan, the debt
                    will no longer be eligible for certain federal programs for loan forgiveness and repayment.
                    There is no option for borrowers to combine private and public loans into a new public loan.

                    A number of employers are also beginning to integrate consolidation services and student loan
                    payment benefits into their employee benefit programs as a way of helping to increase the support
                    available for managing student loan debt after college.

                    Students and their families should consider all of their options before signing up for higher
                    education loans that could become a crushing burden in the future. Some alternatives to—or ways to
                    reduce the size of—loans include working part-time, accepting work-study offers, attending a less
                    expensive school, finding a job that offers tuition reimbursement as a benefit, and applying for
                    scholarships that help to cover the cost of tuition and room and board. When the student has
                    graduated, it also helps to search for a job that offers help with student debt as a benefit.

                <h1>What type of debt are student loans?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Student loans are considered unsecured installment debts, meaning there isn't a physical asset tied
                    to them, and they're paid back in a set number of installments over an agreed-upon period of time.

                <h3>What are the four major types of educational loans?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Direct Subsidized Loans: </b> Loans made to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate a
                    clear
                    financial need.<br>
                    <b> Direct Unsubsidized Loans: </b>Loans made to eligible undergraduate, graduate, and professional
                    students
                    (eligibility isn't based on financial need). <br>
                    <b> Direct PLUS Loans: </b>Loans made to graduate or professional students and parents of dependent
                    undergraduate students to pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid (eligibility
                    isn't based on financial need, though a credit check is required). Borrowers with a poor credit
                    history must meet additional requirements. <br>
                    <b>Direct Consolidation Loans: </b> Loans that allow you to combine your eligible federal student
                    loans into
                    a single loan with one loan servicer.
